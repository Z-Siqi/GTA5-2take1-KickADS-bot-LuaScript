# GTA5 2take1 Menu Ads bots Kick Script

**[中文](https://github.com/Z-Siqi/GTA5-2take1-KickADS-bot-LuaScript)|English**

****

### This is a Lua script based on [2take1](https://gta.2take1.menu/) Menu

*Merged two Lua scripts: one is from web (No source, due to forgot URL) and another one is AntiAdBot.*

> If wrote ads bots cannot detect and prevent ads bot join by menu, please goto `menu->fake friends->search`, then don't put any letter in search text field and press 'Enter'. This will tell menu refresh. But if still cannot, try restart menu

**Changes to original scripts:**

1, Merged two Lua scripts because AntiAdBot script cannot save ads bot to blacklist, another script cannot kick player who sent ads SMS

2, Better ads match words to minimize the number of players who accidentally kicked out of normal chat.
